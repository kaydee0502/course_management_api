# Ruby on Rails : Student and Course Management


## Getting started

To get started with the app, first clone the repo and `cd` into the directory:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/kaydee0502/internship_task-protonest.git 
$ cd internship_task-protonest
```

Then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install
```

Install JavaScript dependencies:

```
$ yarn install
```

Next, migrate the database:
`Note that i've used MySQL as Database, so you might need to configure /config/database.yml`

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
